## Five Interconnected Aspects
1. The seasons change when the predator reaches the end of the screen.
2. The 'water' in the summer canvas uses noise and sine functions to create the rippling effect.
3. The snow in the winter season uses rudimentary physics to fall.
4. The trees in the fall season use recursion and noise to simulate sway.
5. The thunder sample in the spring season only plays when the lightning shows on screen.

My favorite is the thunder, but the most interesting is perhaps the water.

## Multimedia
1. Pictures for the animals
2. Thunder audio sample
3. Video for the summer predator
